/// today:
///
/// * `LocalSQLiteBackend` — opens the local `~/.hermes/state.db` via
///   libsqlite3 and runs queries in-process. Microseconds per query.
/// * `RemoteSQLiteBackend` — invokes `sqlite3 -readonly -json` over an
///   SSH session (ControlMaster keeps the channel warm), parses the
///   JSON response into `Row`s. ~50–100 ms per query.
///
/// The data service picks one based on `ServerContext.isRemote`. View
/// models are oblivious — they keep calling `await dataService.fetch…`
/// like before.
///
/// **Why a protocol, not a class hierarchy.** Backends have very
/// different internals (libsqlite3 handles vs. SSH script piping) but
/// the call-site shape is identical. A protocol lets us hand the data
/// service either backend through one stored property without
/// abstract-class ceremony, and keeps the test mock (see
/// `MockHermesQueryBackend` in tests) free of inheritance baggage.

/// `Sendable`. The protocol conforms to `Sendable` to satisfy Swift 6
