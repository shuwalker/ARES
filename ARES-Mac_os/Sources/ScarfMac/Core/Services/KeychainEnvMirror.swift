/// Mirrors a project's resolved Keychain secrets into a managed region
/// of `~/.hermes/.env` so Hermes cron jobs (and any other agent
/// process Hermes spawns) can use them via `os.environ`.
///
/// **Why this exists.** Hermes has no `keychain://` URI resolver. When
/// a cron prompt says *"read config.json, get values.api_token, call
/// the API,"* Hermes reads the literal `keychain://...` string and
/// forwards it as the token — producing 401s. By mirroring resolved
/// values into `~/.hermes/.env` (which the cron scheduler reloads
/// fresh on every tick at `cron/scheduler.py:897-903`), the agent can
/// reference them via shell expansion (`$SCARF_<SLUG>_<FIELD>`) when
/// it invokes the terminal or code_exec tool.
///
/// **Source of truth stays in the Keychain.** This service derives
/// content; it never accepts plaintext values from callers. config.json
/// continues to store `keychain://` URIs unchanged.
///
/// **Marker contract.** One block per project, slug-namespaced:
/// `# scarf-secrets:begin <slug>` / `# scarf-secrets:end <slug>`. The
/// splice logic lives in ScarfCore's `SecretsEnvBlock`. Other slugs'
/// blocks and user-authored content outside any block are preserved
/// byte-identically.
///
/// **Trust boundary.** Mode 0600 on `~/.hermes/.env` is enforced by
/// `LocalTransport.writeFile`'s heuristic for `.env` paths. Plaintext
/// on disk matches the existing trust model for `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
/// and other Hermes-side credentials in the same file.
