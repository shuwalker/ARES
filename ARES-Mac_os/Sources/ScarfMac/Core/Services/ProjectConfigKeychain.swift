/// Scarf doesn't have other Keychain users yet so this file is the one
/// place that touches the `Security` framework; keep it small and
/// auditable so a reader can tell at a glance what we store, under what
/// identifiers, and when items are removed.
///
/// **What we store.** Generic passwords (kSecClassGenericPassword) in
/// the login Keychain. Each item is identified by a (service, account)
/// pair derived from the template slug + field key + project-path hash
/// — see `TemplateKeychainRef.make`. The stored Data is the user's
/// raw secret bytes; we never transform or encode them.
///
/// **When items are written.** By `ProjectTemplateInstaller` after the
/// install preview is confirmed and the user has filled in the
/// configure sheet. By `TemplateConfigSheet` when the user edits a
/// secret field post-install.
///
/// **When items are removed.** By `ProjectTemplateUninstaller`,
/// iterating the lock file's `configKeychainItems` list. The login
/// Keychain is never swept for stray entries — if the lock is out of
/// sync we log + skip rather than guess which items are ours.
///
/// **What shows to the user.** macOS prompts "Scarf wants to access
/// the Keychain" the first time we read a secret in a given session.
/// User approves; subsequent reads in that session are silent. We
/// never bypass this — the prompt is the user's trust boundary.
