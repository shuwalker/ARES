/// Quits the running app and brings up a fresh instance of the same
/// bundle. Used by the Profile-switching flow (issue #70) so the new
/// active profile lands in a process that has never observed the old
/// one — sidesteps any in-process cache or service-state bug that
/// might still be reading from the previous profile's home directory.
///
/// The pairing is intentional:
/// 1. Caller invokes `try AppRelauncher.relaunch()`. That spawns a
///    fresh `open -n <bundleURL>`, captures stderr/exitCode, returns
///    success once the launcher has acknowledged the dispatch.
/// 2. Caller schedules `NSApp.terminate(nil)` 250ms later. The
///    250ms gives macOS time to begin launching the second PID so
///    the dock-icon hand-off looks smooth (no flash of missing
///    icon). Without the gap, macOS can briefly show zero Scarf
///    icons in the dock.
///
/// Refuses to relaunch when the running bundle is under
/// `DerivedData/` or `Build/Products/Debug` — that's an Xcode
/// debug session, and `terminate(nil)` would kill the run mid-debug
/// without giving the new instance any way to attach. The caller
/// surfaces a "restart manually" toast in that case.
